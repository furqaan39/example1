			<h1>Most Common Questions</h1>
			<section class="q">
				<h3>What is Islam All About?</h3>
				<p>Islam is the name of the religion that Muslims follow. People who practice Islam are called Muslims, just like those who practice Christianity are called Christians. The literal and lexical meaning of Islam means submission. Islam comes from the root Arabic letters s-l-m which are the same root letters the word peace (salam) comes from. The term Islam itself does not mean peace, but it implies that one finds peace (salam) through submission (islam). </p>

				<p>Muslims believe in one God which is Allah. Quran is the word of Allah. And its main message is that the god is one.
				Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the last and final Messenger of Allah. </p>

				<h3>What is the purpose of Coming to this Duniya?</h3>
				<p>The main purpose of Coming to this Duniya is to worship Allah.  This Duniya is merely a deception and it is temporary. It is a test for human beings. So to pass the test and go to jannah we need to worship Allah and follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) , the final Messenger.</p>

				<h3>What are the Pillars of Islam?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><span>Shahadah (declaration of faith)</span>—to bear witness or testify that there is no god except one God (Allah) and Muhammad is His prophet or messenger.</li>
					<li><span>Salat (ritual prayer)</span>—the five daily prayers are performed at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset and night. The prayers are offered in Arabic language and facing the direction of Mecca.</li>
					<li><span>Zakah (alms tax)</span> –Giving 2.5% of one's wealth to the poor and needy.</li>
					<li><span>Sawm (fasting)</span>—Muslims fast during the daylight hours in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar called Ramadan. The purpose is to remind people of the goodness of what they have and to show equality with the poor. Ramadan is a time for study and self-discipline. </li>
					<li><span>Hajj (pilgrimage)</span>: Muslims believe in making a pilgrimage to Mecca to the Ka'bah at least once in their lifetime. The kA'bah is believed to have been built by Ibrahim (Abraham) and one of his sons. Muhammad restored it to worship Allah. For this reason it is a very sacred place to Muslims.</li>
